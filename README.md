Open the ddstream.py or the xp version of the script in your favourite editor, run the flask server on your linux box with the storage path set correctly, set the ip of the Linux box in ddstream.py, run ddstream.py in powershell, if you have putty open running the flask server on the linux machine, then you should see all the blocks of the disk image stream across. On Earlier than Windows 10, you need the dd tool and the environment variables set in windows for dd.

This script will stream all mounted disk drives on Windows to a linux storage machine in iso format, 4mb blocks.

Files are saved with the MAC address of the streaming computer in the file name for easy assorting.
